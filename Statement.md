## Problem statement
To Crete an application to compare mobile handheld devices 

### Current Functional Scope (What it actually does)
Objective Comparison: It removes marketing fluff. Instead of hearing "Super Fast Chip," it assigns a hard number (e.g., 98 points) to tell you exactly how fast it is compared to others.

Price-to-Performance Ratio: Its main goal is to identify Value. It answers the question: "Is the 20% performance boost worth the 50% price increase?"

Educational Tool: It serves as a great template for Python learners to understand how to build GUIs (tkinter), handle dictionaries (CPU_DB), and implement basic algorithms.


###Future Potential (Where could it go?)
If you wanted to expand the scope later, you could:

Add Web Scraping: Make the app automatically fetch the price and specs from Amazon/Flipkart when you paste a link.

Camera Scoring: Add a "Camera Sensor" dropdown (e.g., Sony IMX sensors vs. generic) to include photography in the score.

Save/Export: Allow users to save their comparisons as a PDF or Excel file.

In short: The scope is currently a "Raw Performance Calculator" designed to help you make a logical, mathematically backed purchase.


#### Limitations (What is out of scope?)
Subjective Features: It currently cannot score things that are hard to measure with numbers, like Camera Quality, Build Quality (plastic vs. glass), or Software Experience (OneUI vs. iOS).

Automatic Data: It does not scrape the internet. The user must manually input the RAM, Price, and Model.

Battery/Charging: The current logic doesn't account for battery size or charging speed.


#### Targeted users
  1. mobile gamers : Those who heavily rely on performance !!

  2. to get the best value for money,

  3. the people who compare : People who open 15 tabs in their browser to compare devices side-by-side but get overwhelmed by the data.
